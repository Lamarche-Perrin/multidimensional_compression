# Multidimensional Compression

This program implements a combinatorial algorithm for the lossy
compression of multidimensional datasets by computing optimal rectangular
partitions. A trade-off between the size of the resulting partition and
the information loss it induces is optimised by dynamic programming. In
addition, feasibility constraints can be express on the subsets that might
appear in such partitions. For details regarding the formal grounds of this
work, please refer to:
